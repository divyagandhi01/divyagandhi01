## About me

### What’s the best way to communicate with me inside GitHub?
💛 I love people.💛

💙 I love seeing people on Zoom and talking to beautiful humans. The zoom fatigue thing that's hitting everyone. Nope, not me. I promise! 🍿

My GitHub calendar is public and I'm happy to talk to you any day, just block some time on my calendar with an agenda. If you want to _just see me_, just add the agenda as "👋 Divya, long time, no see." 

However, in case you are optimizing for your focus hours and want to meet me asynchronously, here are my typical response times:

- _@ mention me on GitHub_: I'll get back to you within a day. Long running product issues, PR reviews generally fall in this category. I'll provide thoughtful, well-researched responses in this category.
- _@ mention me on Slack_: I'll get back to you whenever I next get to slack between meetings, typically 2-4 hours. Customer support issues, ℹ️ issues fall in this category.
- _Slack DM_: I'll get back to you whenever I next get to slack between meetings, typically 2-4 hours.
- _@-mention me in slack DM_: I'll throw everything out the door (including my current meeting/commitments) and prioritize this. Dog videos, /r/childrenfallingover content typically fall in this category.
