## About me

### What’s the best way to communicate with me inside GitHub?
💛 I love people.💛

💙 I love seeing people on Zoom and talking to beautiful humans. The zoom fatigue thing that's hitting everyone. Nope, not me. I promise! 🍿

My GitHub calendar is public and I'm happy to talk to you any day, just block some time on my calendar with an agenda. If you want to _just see me_, just add the agenda as "👋 Divya, long time, no see." If you need something from me, just state it in the agenda to help me help you.

However, in case you are optimizing for your focus hours and want to meet me asynchronously, here are my typical response times:

- _@ mention me on GitHub_: I'll get back to you within a day. Long running product issues, PR reviews generally fall in this category. I'll provide thoughtful, well-researched responses in this category.
- _@ mention me on Slack_: I'll get back to you whenever I next get to slack between meetings, typically 2-4 hours. Customer support issues, ℹ️ issues fall in this category.
- _Slack DM_: I'll get back to you whenever I next get to slack between meetings, typically 2-4 hours.
- _@-mention me in slack DM_: I'll throw everything out the door (including my current meeting/commitments) and prioritize this. Dog videos, /r/childrenfallingover content typically fall in this category.

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* I usually get out of their way and ask questions. Over time I've found that people really know a lot about where they want to be and just need
	
### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* Seeing is believing. Tell me what's your personal motivation to pursue the current direction/decision, tell me what are you optimizing for?
	 
### How do you like to give feedback?
* If it's impacting any ongoing conversation or collaboration effort, I will provide direct feedback in slack DM. Things like: 'Hey, this is how we can work better together' or 'Hey, help me understand what I'm doing!' I'll usually be brief and try to find some common ground where we can build trust or working relationship.
* If you request me direct feedback for your professional/career growth, I'll be explicit and rely on quarterly reflectives with clear examples. Things like: 'Hey, remember when that customer bulldozed us to do things, here's how I think we could have dealt with that conversation better.' I'll optimize my feedback for clarity and include actionable items. Things like 'love-your-CI-skills', 'fond-of-your-summary-docs',  'please-use-more-documentation', 'write-more-tests' etc. Unless I can provide actionable items, my feedback is personal and doesn't apply universally for anyone! If it's not actionable feedback, I would reverse sides and ask you for more feedback on our working relationship. Remember line-1 of this README? 💜💜

* *Tell us the modes, means, timing, approach, and level of detail you like to employ when giving feedback, and why that's so.*

### How do you like to get feedback?
* Use slack DMs, reflectives to provide feedback to me. I appreciate both actionable and not-actionable feedback. I believe in resonating energies. If there's sth that resonates negatively with you, let me know! 
* *Tell us the modes, means, timing, approach, and level of detail you like to see others employ when giving you feedback, and why that's so.*
