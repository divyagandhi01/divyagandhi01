## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* I'm a wannabe artist at my craft- never perfect, only reasonably good. Perseverance and solving simple problems keeps me employed. 
* Auth and identity are the only solved problems in tech.
* English isn't my first language. 

### What‚Äôs the best way to communicate with me (inside GitHub)?

üíõ I love people.üíõ
üíô I love seeing people on Zoom and talking to beautiful humans. The zoom fatigue thing that's hitting everyone. Nope, not me. I promise! üçø

My GitHub calendar is public and I'm happy to talk to you any day, just block some time on my calendar with an agenda. If you want to _just see me_, just add the agenda as _"üëã Divya, long time, no see."_ If you need something from me, just state it in the agenda to help me help you.

However, in case you are optimizing for your focus hours and want to meet me asynchronously, here are my typical response times:

- _@ mention me on GitHub_: I'll get back to you within a day. Long running product issues, PR reviews generally fall in this category. I'll provide thoughtful, well-researched responses in this category.
- _@ mention me on Slack_: I'll get back to you whenever I next get to slack between meetings, typically 0-2 hours. Customer support issues, ‚ÑπÔ∏è issues fall in this category.
- _Slack DM_: I'll get back to you whenever I next get to slack between meetings, typically 0-2 hours.
- _@-mention me in slack DM_: I'll throw everything out the door (including my current meeting/commitments) and prioritize this. Dog videos, /r/childrenfallingover content typically fall in this category.

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* I usually get out of their way and ask questions. I learnt that people really know a lot about where they want to be and mostly need feedback about their approach. I ask questions to listen and deep-dive into any issues. Occasionally, I help them quantify and articulate their own fears or doubts. 
	
### What‚Äôs the best way to convince you to do something?
* Seeing is believing. Tell me what's your motivation to pursue the current direction. Tell me what are you optimizing for? My super-secret, super-awesome tool to build alignment: [this](https://fastgood.cheap/)! 
	 
### How do you like to give feedback?
* If it's impacting any ongoing conversation or collaboration effort, I will provide direct feedback in slack DM. Things like: 'Hey, this is how we can work better together' or 'Hey, help me understand what I'm doing!' I'll usually be brief and try to find some common ground where we can build trust.
* If you request me direct feedback for your professional/career growth, I'll be explicit and rely on quarterly reflectives with clear examples. Things like: 'Hey, remember when that customer bulldozed us to do things, here's how I think we could have dealt with that conversation better.' I'll provide clear feedback and include actionable items. Things like 'love-your-CI-skills', 'fond-of-your-summary-docs',  'please-use-more-documentation', 'write-more-tests' etc. I'll refrain from providing feedback unless it's actionable. üíúüíú
